# Film Database Viewer - C# WPF
In WPF, you will design a graphical user interface for browsing the film database. You will build an application inspired by the well-known IMDB portal. When creating the application, we will focus on the most important functionalities. At the top is a menu with options, settings, and search. Below is a movie with information and the possibility to rate the movie. During the tutorial, you will implement the complete management of the films (adding, removing, editing, viewing, searching, filtering, rating, etc.).
